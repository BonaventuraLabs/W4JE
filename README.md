This is a a project of two friends who decided one day to learn python.
They wanted to learn object oriented programming with Python and what can serve better for this purpose than writing a good game?

Therefore we start!

Current controls:

Numpad Enter
end turn

Numpad 5:

Numpad 0:
center camera on Castle

Key c:

THis update: 
1) Map generation based on txt file.
2) The generated map is now in the originally planned form.
3) Villages where gold can be picked up per user.
4) If a user stops by own village he gets gold and when he delivers gold back to the home base town it is counted. So, there is game winning situation now available.
5) Some new improved tile graphics (mountains, sand).
