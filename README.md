# W4JE
This is a a project of two friends who decided one day to learn python.
They wanted to learn object oriented programming with Python and what can serve better for this purpose than writing a good game?

Therefore we start!

Current controls:
Ship Movement:

 t    y
  \  /
f--  --h
  /  \
 v    b

These controls are better suited for hexagone moves

g - end of turn

Numpad Enter
end turn

Numpad 5:
center camera on ship

Numpad 0:
center camera on Castle

Key c:
collect item

Key i:
info on current ship

Key d:
debug mode.

This update:
Image of the ship and sailing length depend on type of the ship.
Turn ends automatically if there are no moves left.
Battle is re-worked. 
Turn model is re-worked to skip defeated players and ships in the turn.
Camera is centralised on the moving ship.
Some extra ship information is added to the left hand side pane.
